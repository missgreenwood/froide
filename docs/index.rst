==================================

Froide is a Freedom of Information portal written in Python using the Django Web framework. It manages contactable entities, requests and much more. Users can send emails to these entities and receive public answers via the platform.

It was developed to power `Frag den Staat <https://fragdenstaat.de>`_ â€“ the German
Freedom of Information Portal, but is internationalized, localized and themeable.
